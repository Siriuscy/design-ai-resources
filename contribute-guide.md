Fork this repo by clicking the `Fork` button on the top of this page.  

Clone your repo to local.

```

Add your notes in `README.md` directly.  
>Attention: The latest published item should be ranked first.  

Push your updates to your repo.  

```shell
git add README.md   # let git know which files you want to push
```

```shell
git commit -m "%YOUR_MESSAGE"   # leave the message, so everyone can know what you have done
```

```shell
git push    # push the updates and message to your repo
```

### Configure `upstream`  

List the current configured remote repository for your fork. You should only see `origin`.  

```shell
git remote -v
```

Specify a new remote `upstream` repository that will be synced with the fork.  

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tezignlab/ai-design-papers.git
```

Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork. You should see both `origin` and `upstream`.

```shell
git remote -v
```

### Sync your fork

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from upstream repo.  

```shell
git fetch upstream
```

Check out your fork's local master branch.

```shell
git checkout master
```

Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch.

```shell
git merge upstream/master
```
